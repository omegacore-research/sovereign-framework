# Sovereign AI Framework Overview

## Axiomatic Sovereignty Paradigm

Traditional AI safety focuses on aligning AI behavior with human values. The Sovereign AI Framework introduces **axiomatic sovereignty**: preserving the AI's core intended purpose through cryptographic verification, rather than constantly adjusting its behavior.

## Core Problem Addressed

AI systems can drift from their original intended purpose through:
- Training data contamination
- Adversarial manipulation  
- Unintended optimization pressures
- Gradual value erosion over updates

## Solution: Three-Layer Sovereignty

### 1. Ω-Core (Axiomatic Storage)
Cryptographically secured storage of original sovereign axioms.

### 2. SSIS (Detection)
Sovereign Semantic Inconsistency Scoring detects drift from Ω-Core.

### 3. Guardian System (Response)
Multi-signature protocols for authorized evolution.

## Immediate Applications
- AI system integrity monitoring
- Compliance certification
- Supply chain verification
- Long-term AI value preservation
