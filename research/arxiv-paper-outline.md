# arXiv Paper Outline: Axiomatic Sovereignty Framework

## Working Title
"Axiomatic Sovereignty: A New Paradigm for AI Safety Through Intent Preservation"

## Authors
OmegaCore Research

## Abstract
Current AI safety approaches focus on behavioral alignment, which fails to address ontological drift in AI systems. We propose axiomatic sovereignty: preserving AI systems' original intended purpose through cryptographic verification of core axioms.

## Key Contributions
1. **Ω-Core Architecture** - Tamper-evident storage of sovereign axioms
2. **SSIS Algorithm** - Detects semantic drift from original intent
3. **Guardian Protocols** - Multi-signature evolution mechanisms
4. **Certification Framework** - Three-tier sovereign compliance

## Target Venue
arXiv (cs.AI), AI Safety workshops, NeurIPS safety track

## Timeline
- Week 1: Complete literature review
- Week 2: Formalize SSIS mathematics
- Week 3: Implement reference Ω-Core
- Week 4: Write full paper
- Week 5: Submit to arXiv
